Overview
Connect Four is a two player game. Each player picks a color and then they each take turns dropping their colored piece into the top of a horizontal board. This causes the piece to fall straight down to the next open space within the column. The objective is to be the player to form a 4 piece line, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, with their color pieces.
I’ve chosen to make it because I believe it to be a good game to flex the skills I’ve acquired in the past week while still leaving much room for enhancements at a later time.

Initial Thoughts on Game Structure
Challenges
Getting the game to function properly (i.e. having it recognize which space to drop into)
Fusing all the code together properly
Ideas I want to come up with and incorporate
I’d like to give the player the ability to use the colored piece of their choice
I’d like to give the player the ability to place an emoji on their pieces
I’d like to get the computer to be able to truly challenge the player vs. random
I’d like to give the player the ability to modify the size of the board
I’d like to see the piece dropping down the board
I’d like to have a high score list
Phases of Completion
Phase I
Pseudocode & break down into smaller components
Phase II
CSS → HTML → JS for basic game
Phase III
Incorporate above listed ideas
