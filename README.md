Overview & How- to play instructions:
Connect Four is a two player game. Each player picks a color and then they each take turns dropping their colored piece into the top of a horizontal board. This causes the piece to fall straight down to the next open space within the column. The objective is to be the player to form a 4 piece line, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, with their color pieces.
I’ve chosen to make it because I believe it to be a good game to flex the skills I’ve acquired in the past week while still leaving much room for enhancements at a later time.

Initial Thoughts on Game Structure:

Challenges:
Getting the game to function properly (i.e. having it recognize which space to drop into)
Fusing all the code together properly
Ideas I want to come up with and incorporate
Give player the ability to use the colored piece of their choice
Give player the ability to place an emoji on their pieces
Give the computer to be able to truly challenge the player vs. random
Give the player the ability to adjust the size of the board
Graphic to see piece dropping down the board
High score list


Phases of Completion (Approach Taken):

Phase I:
Pseudocode & break down into smaller components
User clicks new game & we collect player info
User picks level of difficulty
Play begins
Place piece
Check column for room
Check win above, sides, diagonal
Check win
Switch turns

Phase II:
JS → HTML → CSS

Phase III:
Incorporate previously listed ideas
Graphics and Audio
Landing page
De-bug

Unsolved Problems:
High score list
Menu with players’ information
Alternate which player begins
Bottom right cell won’t populate
Some wins are not registered
Game should restart after win, not continue
